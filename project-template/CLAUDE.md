# Project Memory Bank

## 🎯 Project Conventions
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow functional programming patterns
- Write tests before implementation

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes
- TS2304 error: Missing import - always check import statements
- Authentication timeout: Caused by expired tokens, refresh before API calls
- Navigation not working: Caused by undefined JavaScript functions, missing event handlers, or syntax errors - ensure functions are globally defined and use multiple fallback mechanisms

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- Always read files before modifying them
- Use absolute imports (@/components) not relative paths
- Commit frequently with conventional commit format
- Remove debug console.log statements before deploying to production
- Ensure JavaScript functions are defined globally before inline onclick handlers execute
- Use JSON.stringify() for safer string escaping in JavaScript-generated HTML
- Implement multiple fallback navigation mechanisms (event delegation + data attributes + manual switching)
- Clean up external script dependencies causing 404 errors
- Use token optimization scripts (token-monitor.js, task-splitter.js) and environment presets for large tasks to avoid API error 400

**Optimized for:** Low token usage, parallel agent execution, efficient development workflows
**Tools:** Claude Code with DeepSeek model, Playwright tests, Supabase CLI, Vercel deployment, Autonomous QA system, Token optimization scripts
**Pattern:** Use multiple agents in parallel for large-scale tasks with token monitoring and task splitting (HTML updates, JavaScript fixes, test updates, config updates)
